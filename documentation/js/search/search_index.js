That means you don't have to disable each form input field individually. Currently supports: buttons, input fields, text areas, checkboxes, selects.\nDemo\n\nGetting started\nInstallation\nnpm i ngx-auto-disable-forms --saveImport\nJust import the module 'NgxAutoDisableFormsModule' in your 'app.module.ts' file.\ni.e. \nimport { NgxAutoDisableFormsModule } from 'ngx-auto-disable-forms';\n\n@NgModule({\n  imports: [\n      NgxAutoDisableFormsModule\n  ],\n})Interface Implementation\nGo to your component, where fields should be disabled. And implement the interface 'OnRolesAndPermissions' i.e.\n@Component({\n  selector: 'test-component',\n  templateUrl: './test.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./test.component.scss'],\n})\nexport class TestComponent implements OnRolesAndPermissions {\n\n  /**\n   * @override\n   * Checks if the view should be displayed in read only mode.\n   *\n   * @returns if true, the view's input form fields are disabled.\n   */\n  isViewReadOnly(): boolean {\n      return true; // depends on roles and permissions\n  }\n\n}Template\nNote that you need to add the attribute 'rolesAndPermissionsRelatedContent' to the div container inside of the components template. \nDepending on roles an permissions all UI input fields inside the div will be disabled automatically.\ni.e. \n\n...\nyour form inputs\n...\nIf needed you can also exclude some input fields from being disabled by adding the css class 'exclude-from-roles-and-permissions'\ni.e. \nOptional\nIf you want you can provide a roles and permission service, to do this create a service and implement the service 'RolesAndPermissionsServiceInterface'\nimport { Injectable, Inject } from '@angular/core';\nimport { RolesAndPermissionsServiceInterface } from 'ngx-auto-disable-forms';\n\n@Injectable()\nexport class UserRolesAndPermissionsService implements RolesAndPermissionsServiceInterface {\n\n  constructor(private userRolesService: UserRolesService) { }\n\n  hasOnlyReadPermissions(user: UserModel): boolean {\n      return this.userRolesService.hasOnlyReadPermissions(user);\n  }\n\n  isAuthorized(user: UserModel): boolean {\n      return this.userRolesService.isUserAuthorized(user);\n  }\n\n  hasWritePermissions(user: UserModel): boolean {\n      return this.userRolesService.hasWritePermissions(user);\n  }\n\n}Additionally you need to provide the service in the 'app.module.ts' file\nimport { NgxAutoDisableFormsModule, RolesAndPermissionsService } from 'ngx-auto-disable-forms';\n\n@NgModule({\n  imports: [\n      NgxAutoDisableFormsModule\n  ],\n  providers: [\n    // optional\n      UserRolesAndPermissionsService, \n      {\n          provide: RolesAndPermissionsService,\n          useExisting: UserRolesAndPermissionsService\n      },\n  ]\n})Now you can use your service in your component\n@Component({\n  selector: 'test-component',\n  templateUrl: './test.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./test.component.scss'],\n})\nexport class TestComponent implements OnRolesAndPermissions {\n\n  constructor(private userRolesAndPermissionsService: UserRolesAndPermissionsService) {}\n\n  /**\n   * @override\n   * Checks if the view should be displayed in read only mode.\n   *\n   * @returns if true, the view's input form fields are disabled.\n   */\n  isViewReadOnly(): boolean {\n      return this.userRolesAndPermissionsService.hasOnlyReadPermissions(this.currentUser);\n  }\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"license.html":{"url":"license.html","title":"getting-started - license","body":"\n                   \n\n                             Apache License\n                       Version 2.0, January 2004\n                    http://www.apache.org/licenses/   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION\n\nDefinitions.\n\"License\" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,\nand distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.\n\"Licensor\" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by\nthe copyright owner that is granting the License.\n\"Legal Entity\" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all\nother entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common\ncontrol with that entity.
